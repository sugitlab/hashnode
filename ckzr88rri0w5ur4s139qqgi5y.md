## Why Flutter makes me exciting.


This post is my first one on hashnode.
Originally, I used the Medium for my english blog post.
But, medium editor is not good for me. It's not good for writing tech information. I don't want to use Gist or something like external tools just for making posts.
I realize hashnode solves such my headaches. üçª

# Today's topic is ... Flutter.

Flutter is a great multi-platform UI framework developed by Google. I started joining the Flutter Fans from 2019, and I've been exciting in 2022 too.

*Why?*

### Hot Reload + Mobile = Every Mobile Developers Dream!!

The most awesome stuff is the Hot Reload feature.
Flutter is originally supported the Android and iOS as its deployment target. 
To develop the mobile Apps by native framework, we need to use Java (or Kotlin) and Swift (or Objective-C). And need to learn the usage of powerful (complex) IDE,  Android Studio and XCode.

THEIR DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCES WERE TERRIBLE FOR ME!!

Too slow build, too slow preview, too heavy editor, too many troubles coming from SDK ...   üòá

**Flutter** solves almost all of them. üéâ

- To preview changes, Flutter needs 5 seconds by Hot Reload. But Android and iOS needs 20~30 seconds.
- Flutter builds code without showing IDE (just using tools in their hidden processes.), so we can use our favorite editor like Vim!!


### Web support, Desktop support, Embedded support ... 

Flutter has already announced the stable version for web and desktop (Windows). That means, actually, same dart code works on any platforms.

There are many multi-platform frameworks saying the similar things, but unfortunately they requires the platform specific codes for many points on the code. But Flutter is working on any platform with actually same code base. Fantastic!!

### Conclusion

Everyone should dive into the Flutter World. üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
